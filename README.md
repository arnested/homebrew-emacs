This contains some [Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew)
formulas for Emacs stuff.

## Formulas

 * [`carton`](Formula/carton.rb)
 
   A formula for installing [carton](https://github.com/rejeep/carton) - _Emacs dependency management made easy_
   
 * [`emacs-mac`](Formula/emacs-mac.rb)
 
   An improved version of the formula distributed together with
   [emacs-mac-port](https://github.com/railwaycat/emacs-mac-port) -

   Nothing else in this formula than my pull request [#11](https://github.com/railwaycat/emacs-mac-port/pull/11).
