This is a [Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew) Tap with
formulas for Emacs stuff.

Install with:

    brew tap arnested/emacs

When you get tired of me breaking stuff uninstall with:

    brew untap arnested/emacs


## Formulas

 * [`carton`](Formula/carton.rb) - _Emacs dependency management made easy_
 
   A formula for installing [carton](https://github.com/rejeep/carton).
   
There used to be a `emacs-mac` formula here as well. I removed it and
instead refer you to the "official" formula:

     brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport

     brew install emacs-mac
